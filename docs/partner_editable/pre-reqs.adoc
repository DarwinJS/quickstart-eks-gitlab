==== Prepare your {partner-company-name} account

A GitLab.com account is not required to deploy this Quick Start. A GitLab license is only required to enable https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/gitlab-com/feature-comparison/["licensed tier only" features].

==== Prepare your AWS account

1. Create an EC2 Keypair in the region you will deploy. You will need to provide the keypair name as a parameter.
2. If deploying into an existing VPC, create 2 or more dedicated subnets for this QuickStart. You will need to provide the subnet ids as parameters.

Ensure that the target AWS account has sufficient remaining service limit quota for items listed in <<Resource quotas>>.  If limits need increasing, make requests using the AWS Service Quotas console and wait until they are all increased before deploying.
