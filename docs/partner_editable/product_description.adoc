GitLab can be deployed to conform to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/10k_users.html#cloud-native-hybrid-reference-architecture-with-helm-charts-alternative[GitLab's Cloud Native Hybrid Architecture] (for any size), which puts all container compatible elements of GitLab into an Amazon EKS cluster and anything else that can be, is implemented using AWS Services (PaaS).
